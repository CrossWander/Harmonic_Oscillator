# Harmonic_Oscillator

Project for tests PC performance by generating a sinusoidal function with different initial conditions. After the generation of the sine wave, it shows how much time was spent for execution. Also, the program has a mode of searching for the maximum frequency of the sinusoidal function that the processor can simulate.
